## Emoji da velha ðŸ‘µ

This is just a personal project for learning purposes. "Emoji da velha" is a wordplay with how we call Tic Tac Toe in portuguese: 'Jogo da velha' (The oldwomen game). When the game comes to a "draw" we say "deu velha" (oldwoman gotcha). Thats why when the game result is a draw the ðŸ‘µ emoji gets a point. You can play the demo [here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Things I learned doing this:

- Basics of Typescript
- Basics of Styled Components
- React Context API
- ESLint configs

What I still wanna learn here:

- Testing with testing-library
