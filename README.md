## Emoji da velha ðŸ‘µ

This is just a personal project for learning purposes. "Emoji da velha" is a wordplay with how we call TicTacToe in portuguese: "Jogo da velha" (The oldwomen game). When the game comes to a tie we say "deu velha" (oldwoman gotcha). Thats why when the game result is a draw the ðŸ‘µ emoji gets a point. You can play the demo [here](https://emoji-da-velha.netlify.app/).

Things I learned doing this:

- Basics of Typescript
- Basics of Styled Components
- React Context API
- ESLint configs

What I still wanna learn here:

- Testing with testing-library
